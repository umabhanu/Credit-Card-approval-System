# Credit-Card-approval-System
This project aims to build a model that can give results on whether a financial institution can approve credit cards to its customer. This card approval decision by financial companies is done based on considering various reasons related to individuals varying from creditworthiness, loan and repayment history, and income standards. This model can help an institution to make a precise judgment on whether a card can be approved or denied for avoiding fraudulence that can impact financial companies with loss. Through the project work, we tried to identify which keynote features played prominent role for decision making through machine learning visualization and analysis technique.
